I used to check for strings on every test case and I had gotten to a point where it pretty much is
correct for 80-90% of the time, but obviously because of the hashing of dictionaries I wasn't able
to have it have the same string nearly every time. But I still made sure to check that I was still
getting the correct dictionary after each of my function calls.
