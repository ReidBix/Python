I completed the required homework 5 programming assignment through Python 3.4.0.
I ran the following into my console/terminal:
	./python hw5.py file.txt
to obtain the following output:
	Yes

assuming the given input file:
    9 3 2

I am very glad that I took the time to learn Python for the homeworks in this class.
It is a very easy to learn and easy to use language with a lot of neat things that
many other languages don't seem to have. I plan on using Python much more in the future
and hope to gain more knowledge on its uses.
This was one of the more difficult to implement homeworks and there were some obstacles that I would
often come across to only realize that I was just looking at the problem in the wrong way, and
I most often of the time already had the correct answer but didn't know that it was.
Attached in the hw5.zip should be:
	hw5.py
	README.txt
and I have assumed that you all will provide the text files.
